00:00.000 --> 00:08.140
Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation

00:08.140 --> 00:14.820
conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

00:14.820 --> 00:21.040
Now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived

00:21.040 --> 00:24.240
and so dedicated can long endure.

00:24.240 --> 00:26.760
We are met on a great battlefield of that war.

00:26.760 --> 00:33.160
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those here

00:33.160 --> 00:35.960
gave their lives that the nation might live.

00:35.960 --> 00:57.080
It is all together fitting and proper that we should do this.
